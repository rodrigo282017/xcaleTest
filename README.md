# Getting Started

## To run the project

### Prerequisites

- Docker must be installed on your system. You can download it from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

3. The project is configured to use jdk 17. If it is not configured, make sure to do it.

4. The postgres image is using port 5432. Make sure this connection is available before to use it, or change it in the compose.yaml file

5. Move to feature/test-xcale branch. The test changes are in that branch. After the revision it will be merged to main

6. Run the project

## Considerations

- About this point --> A cart MUST be deleted automatically due to 10 minutes of
  inactivity
  - I used a scheduled method. It is executed each 10 minutes. But can be changed. I consider the updateDate of the entity to delete the cart. I thought this is because if the cart was in a normal flow... An order should be created from that cart. But it is something I am not 100% secure.
  - I am  using autogenerated uuids in the entities. I clarify this because at one point it says that the products have a numerical id and with this approach the id is alphanumeric... But it seemed better to me for the maintenance of the tables.
  - In the update cart there is a call to the created cart. This is because I am using an entity cart-product with the relation between those two tables and the create method does an upsert.
